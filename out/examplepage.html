Template file example for Pepperoni Pages

    <body>
        <p>This is an example template for the Pepperoni Pages Static Site Generator.</p>
<h1>The P2F format (P<sup>2</sup>epperoni pages Format)</h1>
<p>Every p2f file must include a <em>P2FORMATVER</em> variable. this tells the generator how to parse the file. The latest format version is 0.</p>
<h3>Variables</h3>
<p>Variables are very simple, and lack much purpose. </p>
<p>Example: <code>VariableName=value</code> </p>
<p>VariableName is self-explanatory, it is the variable's name. </p>
<p>value is also simple, just replace this with whatever value you want to set.</p>
<p>In the P2F 0 standard, variables are only used for setting the P2Format version.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Variables cannot be set inside the MD source of the file.</p>
<h3>Creating your page contents</h3>
<p>Once basic setup is complete, you will want to add content to your page. This is done by embedding markdown into the file. </p>
<p>To do this, you must type <code>mdstart</code> into your file. This will tell the parser everything from here until <code>mdend</code> is the contents of the page.</p>
<p>Comments in the non-markdown sections of the file can be added be prefixing the line with <code>!!</code> . </p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Comments cannot start anywhere but the first character of a line, because the parser goes through every single line in the file, and if the first two characters of that line are equal to <code>["?", "!"]</code> respectively, that <strong>entire</strong> line is removed.</p>

<h3>Generator variables</h3>
<p>The generator's behavior may be modified using variables.</p>
<p>These variables are:</p>
